# Simple MBTI Program

I used Certainty Factor method for the calculation. Too long to describe it here, 
so for a brief description, it calculate each weight of each types of personality (Extraversion, Introversion, etc)
based from the answer of each question (about how certain is the user to have that personality), and its going to be
you know, yada yada with how accurate is this question to a certain type of personality and how inaccurate it is.

This program takes the question and the weight of each question from a separate .txt file
(I have yet to know any other way, for now, so yeah).

And after a lil bit of answering each question from each type of personality (I, E, etc), 
it will then compare types of the same dimension (E vs I, S vs N, etc), and decide the dominant dimension.

Then it will goes to quite an extreme if elif (hell) statement.
Im too lazy to rewrite the long combination of personality stuff for 16 different times,
so I did it in 30 small times, idk, its easier to write it that way.
To determine which combination of dominant personality fit the most 
based on the MTBI personality combination (INTJ, ESTP, etc).

You can always add more question and adjust its weight for more accuracy.
